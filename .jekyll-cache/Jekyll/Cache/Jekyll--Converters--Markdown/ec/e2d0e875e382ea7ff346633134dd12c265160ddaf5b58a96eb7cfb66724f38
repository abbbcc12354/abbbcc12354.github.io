<h3 id="see4204-environmental-systems-modeling">SEE4204 Environmental Systems Modeling</h3>
<p>(undergraduate core, spring)</p>

<p>This course aims to instruct students to learn how environmental phenomena works as systems and how to use models to better understand the environmental system and to solve environmental problems. Students will learn basic concepts and strategies for building simple models, designing model experiments, and evaluating model results. Various environmental applications using modelling from a variety of disciplines (e.g. air and water) will also be introduced.</p>

<p>The course includes both lectures and tutorials at computing lab. Major topics include: basic dynamics and kinetics; box model; trajectory model; numerical approaches; modeling atmospheric system; modeling surface water system; model uncertainty and evaluation; model experiment design.</p>

<p>Aerosols are importatn due to their adverse effects on human health and their direct and indirect radiative effects on climate. While  all aerosols scatter light, some aerosols are also able to absorb light. These absorptions are significant and very uncertain factors contributing to global climate forcing.</p>

<p>In the group, we focuse on understanding the sources, lifecycles, and absorption properties of atmospheric aerosols. Current topics include: black carbon and brown carbon; aerosol radiative effects; influence of chemical aging on aerosol optical properties â€¦</p>

This course aims to provide a working knowledge of air quality issues. It will emphasize on a multidisciplinary approach to investigating the emission sources, atmospheric chemistry and removal processes, meteorological phenomena and their impact on pollution at local to global scales. Regional and global issues such as acid rain, ozone depletion and air quality connections to climate change will also be discussed. 

Key topics include: chemistry concepts; atmospheric composition; meteorology and transport; radiation and greenhouse effects; stratospheric chemsitry; tropospheric chemistry; ozone; aerosols and clouds; biogeochemical cycles; air pollution regulations and health effects.

### SEE4219 Air Quality Modeling
(undergraduate elective, fall odd years)

<br />

Air quality models have become fundamental tools to analyze observations, understand relationships, test hypotheses, and project future evolution for air pollution. This course is aimed to provide insight into the methods used in air quality modelling. It will focus on both theory and practice, from the fundamental principles behind models to their applications in interpreting air pollution. 

Key topics include: steady-state dispersion models; Lagrangian transport models; indoor air quality models; chemical transport models; model application and evaluation.

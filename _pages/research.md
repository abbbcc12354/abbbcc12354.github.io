Aerosol pollution significantly impacts atmospheric visibility and poses substantial risks to human health, serving as a crucial factor in Earth's energy budget. It plays a vital role in modulating cloud formation, precipitation patterns, and climate change dynamics. The formation and evolution of aerosol pollution involve complex mechanisms, encompassing both pollutant emissions and microscopic chemical reactions, while being simultaneously influenced by boundary layer processes, meteorological conditions, and climatic factors. Through direct and indirect radiative effects, aerosols modulate the development of atmospheric boundary layer structures, cloud systems, weather patterns, and climate processes. These interactions, in turn, affect the chemical reaction pathways of air pollutants and influence their dispersion and transport conditions. This creates a complex feedback system of atmospheric chemical and physical processes.

This study developed an advanced deep learning framework for three-dimensional reconstruction and prediction of atmospheric NO2 distribution. By integrating MAX-DOAS observations, chemical transport models, and satellite data, the residual-convolutional hybrid neural network achieved NO2 distribution reconstruction at 1-km resolution, demonstrating a correlation coefficient of 0.813 with ground-based observations. Building upon this foundation, an Attention-LSTM prediction model was implemented for 24-hour forecasting, achieving a surface-level correlation of 0.67. The research further proposed an innovative super-resolution reconstruction methodology at hectometer scale, incorporating real-time traffic conditions, POI data, and high-resolution meteorological fields to enhance the spatial resolution to 100m, improving the correlation coefficient to 0.811. This integrated approach presents a novel technical solution for high-precision monitoring of urban-scale atmospheric pollutants.

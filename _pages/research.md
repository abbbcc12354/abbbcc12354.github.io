# Research

Our overarching goal is to explore and understand atmospheric compositions and their impacts on pollution and climate. To do so, we use chemical transport models (CTM) together with observations (from all scales: ground, drone, aircraft, satellite, etc.) to study the chemistry and physics in the atmosphere. 

Here are the main research themes in our group:


## Modeling of Global Tropospheric Chemistry

<br />

Tropospheric chemsitry contributes to a series of issues in the earth system, such as air pollution, climate change, and ecological destruction. Modeling plays an important role in studying tropospheric chemistry by identifying processes, interpreting observations, assessing impacts, and making projections. 

In the group, we develop and use model schemes based on the GEOS-Chem global model framework to study the oxidants, gases, aerosols, and foundamental chemistry in troposphere. Current topics inlcude: tropospheric halogen chemistry; aqueous phase oxidation; SOA model scheme; heterogeneous reactions in clouds ...

## Climate Forcers and their Impacts

<br />

The earth's climate is influenced by both natural and human activities, and closely related to the chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere. Currently, the properties and chemistry of climate forcers, especially those short-lived climate forcers, are significant and very uncertain factors contributing to global climate change.  

In the group, we focus on understanding the lifecycles and properties of hort-lived climate forcers, as well as their interaction with climate policy. Current topics include: optical properties of brown carbon; halogens' climate impact, effects of future urban planning-driven changes under the carbon neutrality background  ...

<br />

Air pollution in Asia is among the worst in the world and have significant impacts on public health and economy. Exposure to particulate matter (PM) and ozone, the major two air pollutants, are responsible for millions of deaths per year. Formations of these pollutants are largely affected by complex chemical reactions and meteorological processes. Recent new measurements in Asia provide important information for invesigating these processes.

In the group, we combine model simulations and measurement analysis to explore the chemical mechanisms controlling the formation of air pollutants, and make recommendations for air pollution control strategies. Current topics include: secondary aerosol formation; air quality in coastal environments; constraining traffic sources ...

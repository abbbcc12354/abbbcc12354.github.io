# Research

Our overarching goal is to investigate climate change mechanisms and their impacts on environmental systems and human health. To do so, we combine climate model simulations with comprehensive observational data analysis (including meteorological data, aerosol measurements, and satellite observations) to study Arctic amplification, dust aerosol variations, and humidity-temperature interactions in regional and global contexts.

Here are the main research themes in our group:


## Arctic amplification as cause for dust reduction

We have discovered that intensified Arctic amplification associated with global warming, which led to changes in atmospheric circulation, is the underlying cause of the decline in dust levels across West and South Asia over the past two decades. However, this phenomenon is a reversible one, and with the ongoing worldwide efforts to fight against global warming, dust levels in the region may rise again in future, suggesting that sustained anti-desertification measures to mitigate dust emission are warranted in the long run.

The research findings have been published in the international academic journal [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)](https://research.hkbu.edu.hk/news/hkbu-led-research-identifies-arctic-amplification-as-cause-for-dust-reduction-and-suggests-sustained-anti-desertification-measures).

## Humidity trends will result in widespread heat stress in China

A study conducted by a research team led by Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) has discovered that there is a trend of increasing humidity in the northern part of China which is not observed in the south. This phenomenon will ultimately become a prominent factor in determining the occurrence of extreme hot and humid weather, and lead to widespread heat stress across the entire eastern part of China, the most populous region of the country, by the end of this century. 

The research findings have been published in the international academic journal [Nature Communications](https://research.hkbu.edu.hk/news/hkbu-led-research-predicts-humidity-trends-will-result-in-widespread-heat-stress-in-china).

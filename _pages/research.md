Below are the topics we have been working on:


## How climate variability affects atmospheric composition and implications for seasonal predictions

Climate variability can significantly affect atmospheric composition in several ways, and understanding these interactions is crucial for making accurate seasonal predictions. Our study has elucidated the dominant climate patterns driving the interannual variability of wintertime aerosol pollution over northern India, co-occurring heat and ozone extremes over China, summertime ozone in May and wintertime haze in Beijing. We are working with climate scientists to explore inter-annual variability of compound extremes in Asia.

The research findings have been published in the international academic journal [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)](https://research.hkbu.edu.hk/news/hkbu-led-research-identifies-arctic-amplification-as-cause-for-dust-reduction-and-suggests-sustained-anti-desertification-measures).

## Aerosol-weather-climate interactions

Aerosols can either cool the climate (through scattering) or warm it (through absorption), depending on their type and concentration. Incorporating aerosols into weather and climate models is essential for accurate weather and climate projections. Models that account for aerosol interactions can provide better forecasts of temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events. We are trying to better represent aerosol properties, particularly light-absorbing particles (e.g., dust, black carbon and brown carbon), in weather and climate models, and to explore the interactions across different scales.  

The research findings have been published in the international academic journal [Nature Communications](https://research.hkbu.edu.hk/news/hkbu-led-research-predicts-humidity-trends-will-result-in-widespread-heat-stress-in-china).
